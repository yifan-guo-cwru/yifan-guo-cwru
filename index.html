<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Yifan Guo is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at Towson University (TU) since August 2022. Before joining TU, he obtained 
his Ph.D. degree in Computer and Information Sciences from Case Western Reserve University under the supervision of Dr. Pan Li in 2022, his M.S. degree in Computer 
Science from Northwestern University in 2015, and his B.S. degree in Information and Computing Sciences from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications 
in 2013. </p>
<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>His research interests focus on security and privacy issues and optimization algorithm designs in intelligent learning systems with an emphasis on anomaly detection, 
adversarial training, and robust federated learning and their applications on the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-physical Systems (CPS), wireless communications and 
smart health, etc. His current research goal is to investigate the intercorrelation between security and practical deep learning systems in two folds: 1) developing 
efficient, scalable, and implementable deep learning schemes for security applications in IoT systems; 2) investigating the vulnerability of practical deep learning 
systems, and ultimately, developing robust defense strategies to address the security and privacy concerns in both distributed and decentralized settings.</p>
<h2>Openings</h2>
<p>I am always looking for highly self-motivated Master and/or Ph.D. students who are strongly committed to research.</p>
